- New token issues (max 4m/30 days) update `c` s.t. `c'=E/((2/3)x'*sqrt(x'))` where `x'` is the new token quantity.
- Ether/Love dynamic rate of `dE=(2/3)*c*x'*sqrt(x')-(2/3)*c*x*sqrt(x)` where `dE` is change in total Ether in contract and `x'-x` is change in total Love.
- 2.5% spread between offering Love and offering Ether, paid by Love sacrificers.
- 0.0% dev fee until Biffy's governance is fully decentralized.
### Bastet's Invocation
- Approved addresses only, not available to public.
