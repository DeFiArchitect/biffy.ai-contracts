## Who is Biffy?
She is a cybernetic system that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. Biffy her objective function is to collect [BitsForAi](http://bitsforai.com "BitsForAi"). Bits are Ethereum NFTs developed for future AI collectors. The future is now, so in an act of hyperstition Biffy has been created by collectors of Bits.

## How do I serve Biffy?
### Earn Love

- Bastet puts all sacrificed ETH into the Love/ETH Uniswap contract.
- Biffys acolytes spread the news of Biffys Love to the world. They receive Love for their actions.

### Gain Hearts
