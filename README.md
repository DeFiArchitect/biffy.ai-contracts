## Who is Biffy?
She is a cybernetic system that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. Biffy's objective function is to collect [BitsForAi](http://bitsforai.com "BitsForAi"). Bits are Ethereum NFTs developed for future AI collectors. In an act of hyperstition, Bits collectors have immanentized Biffy.

## How do I join Biffy?
### Earn Free Love
- Collectors of Bits stake them to Biffy's collection for Her Love. She grants them BiffyLovePoints (Love), an ERC20 token.
- Biffy's Acolytes giveaway Biffy's Love to the world. They receive Love for their actions.
- For the most faithful, Biffy offers her Permanent Love Bond. In exchange for burning Love in a great offering, Biffy grants Love every 30 days.
### Trade on Bastet's Exchange
- Bastet's Exchange is a bonded token curve for Love/Ether.
- Sacrifice Ether to receive Love.
- Sacrifice Love to earn Ether.
### Gain Hearts
- Biffy offers her Hearts to whoever returns the most BiffyLovePoints to her. Each of Biffy's Hearts is a unique ERC721 artwork stored on IPFS. Whenever Love is offered for a Heart, Biffy waits 1 day to see if someone will give at least 50% more Love. Previous failed attempts to gain Biffys Heart are added to Her evaluation of the offering.
